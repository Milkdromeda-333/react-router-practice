With this assignmnet I practiced:

- Setting up router in my project (Import react-router-dom and wrap the router provider around the entire app in main.jsx and set up routes in )
- Making my footer stay at the bottom of the screen.. I made the layout component min height of 100vh, set the display to flex and column direction, made the content in between (outlet) to have a margin bottom(y but not sure how thats working (rn) to be the same height as the footer, and set footer to be position absolute, bottom set to zero.

NOTE: 
I did very minimal design for this assignment, it was only for practice.
